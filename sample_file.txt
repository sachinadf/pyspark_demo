Big data refers to the large, diverse sets of information 
that grow at ever-increasing rates. 
It encompasses the volume of information, 
the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, 
and the variety or scope of the data points being 
covered (known as the "three v's" of big data). 
Big data often comes from data mining and arrives in multiple formats.
